## ⚙️ Requirements

* Linux (GNOME desktop)
* Spotify must be **running** and installed via the ***official*** package (Snap versions may block DBus access)
* Python 3.8+

### Python dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
python3 spotify-wallpaper.py
```

That’s it. The wallpaper will automatically update when the track changes.

---

## 📦 Installation
### (This <i><b>will</b></i> depend on whether you use a debian based linux or not)

for debian, you'll add this first:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install dbus
```
#### then either way you need this:

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moi-mimil/spotify-wallpaper.git
cd spotify-wallpaper
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run:

```bash
python3 spotify-wallpaper.py
```

---

## 🧠 How it works

* Uses **MPRIS (DBus)** to fetch Spotify metadata
* Downloads the current album cover
* Applies a blur + scaling effect using Pillow
* Sets it as the GNOME wallpaper via `gsettings`

---

## ⚠️ Notes

* Works on **GNOME** (uses `gsettings`)
* Requires Spotify to be running
* Internet is needed to fetch album covers (unless cached locally)
